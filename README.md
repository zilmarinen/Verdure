# Verdure
Verdure is a Swift package written to facilitate the generation of foliage meshes to model trees in a simplistic but stylised fashion. Verdure generates a stylized, low poly set of foliage meshes that can be used as a tileset for foliage decoration.

# Installation
To install using Swift Package Manager, add this to the `dependencies:` section in your Package.swift file:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/zilmarinen/Verdure.git", .upToNextMinor(from: "0.1.0")),
```

## Dependencies
[Deltille](https://github.com/zilmarinen/deltille) is a Swift library for working with hexagonal and triangular grid systems.

[Euclid](https://github.com/nicklockwood/Euclid) is a Swift library for creating and manipulating 3D geometry and is used extensively within this project for mesh generation and vector operations.

[Lattice](https://github.com/zilmarinen/lattice) is a Swift component library that extends and builds upon `Deltille` providing utility methods for common design patterns.
